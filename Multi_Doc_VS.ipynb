So instead of doing one chunk at a time and making api call of embedding for that one chunk then adding it to the vector store one by one, we make a batch of multiple chunks and make a single api call per batch and do this for all the batches first and then add all the embeddings to the vector store in one go\n",

            "[Document(page_content=\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\nSatoshi Nakamoto\\nsatoshin@gmx.com\\nwww.bitcoin.org\\nAbstract.  A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online \\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a \\nfinancial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main \\nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. \\nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. \\nThe network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of \\nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing \\nthe proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of \\nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As \\nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to \\nattack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The \\nnetwork itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort \\nbasis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest \\nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\\n1.\\nIntroduction\\nCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as \\ntrusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for \\nmost  transactions,  it  still  suffers  from  the  inherent  weaknesses  of  the  trust  based  model. \\nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot \\navoid  mediating  disputes.   The  cost of mediation  increases  transaction  costs,  limiting  the \\nminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, \\nand there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-\\nreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must \\nbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. \\nA certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties \\ncan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments \\nover a communications channel without a trusted party.\\nWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, \\nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted \\nthird party.  Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers \\nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.  In \\nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed \\ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The \\nsystem  is  secure  as long  as  honest  nodes collectively  control more  CPU  power  than  any \\ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\\n1\\n\", metadata={'source': 'Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/test_folder/Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'page': 0, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Writer', 'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext, AppendMode 1.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20090324173315Z00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240113122424Z00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"8.\\nSimplified Payment Verification\\nIt is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep \\na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying \\nnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch \\nlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.  He can't check the transaction for \\nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, \\nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more \\nvulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.  While network nodes can verify \\ntransactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated \\ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.  One strategy to \\nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid \\nblock, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to \\nconfirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to \\nrun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\\n9.\\nCombining and Splitting Value\\nAlthough it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a \\nseparate transaction for every cent in a transfer.  To allow value to be split and combined, \\ntransactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.  Normally there will be either a single input \\nfrom a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two \\noutputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.  \\nIt should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those \\ntransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.  There is never the need to extract a \\ncomplete standalone copy of a transaction's history.\\n5\\nTransaction\\nIn\\n...\\nIn\\nOut\\n...\\nHash01\\nHash2\\nHash3\\nHash23\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nMerkle Branch for Tx3\\nLongest Proof-of-Work Chain\\nTx3\\n\", metadata={'source': 'Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/test_folder/Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Writer', 'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext, AppendMode 1.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20090324173315Z00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240113122424Z00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content=\"New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.  As long as they reach \\nmany nodes, they will get into a block before long.  Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped \\nmessages.  If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and \\nrealizes it missed one.\\n6.\\nIncentive\\nBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned \\nby the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides \\na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. \\nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending \\nresources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is \\nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of \\nthe block containing the transaction.  Once a predetermined number of coins have entered \\ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation \\nfree.\\nThe incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.  If a greedy attacker is able to \\nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it \\nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to \\nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than \\neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\\n7.\\nReclaiming Disk Space\\nOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before \\nit can be discarded to save disk space.  To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, \\ntransactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. \\nOld blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.  The interior hashes do \\nnot need to be stored.\\nA block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.  If we suppose blocks are \\ngenerated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.  With computer systems \\ntypically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of \\n1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in \\nmemory.\\n4\\nBlock\\nBlock\\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nHash01\\nHash0\\nHash1\\nHash2\\nHash3\\nHash23\\nRoot Hash\\nHash01\\nHash2\\nTx3\\nHash23\\nBlock Header (Block Hash)\\nRoot Hash\\nTransactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree\\nAfter Pruning Tx0-2 from the Block\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nHash3\\nTx0\\nTx1\\nTx2\\nTx3\\n\", metadata={'source': 'Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/test_folder/Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'page': 3, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Writer', 'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext, AppendMode 1.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20090324173315Z00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240113122424Z00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='References\\n[1]\\nW.

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online \\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a \\nfinancial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main \\nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. \\nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. \\nThe network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of \\nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing \\nthe proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of \\nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As \\nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to \\nattack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The \\nnetwork itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort \\nbasis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest \\nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\\n1.\\nIntroduction\\nCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as \\ntrusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for \\nmost  transactions,  it  still  suffers  from  the  inherent  weaknesses  of  the  trust  based  model. \\nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot \\navoid  mediating  disputes.   The  cost of mediation  increases  transaction  costs,  limiting  the \\nminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, \\nand there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-\\nreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must \\nbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. \\nA certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties \\ncan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments \\nover a communications channel without a trusted party.\\nWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, \\nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted \\nthird party.  Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers \\nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.  In \\nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed \\ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The \\nsystem  is  secure  as long  as  honest  nodes collectively  control more  CPU  power  than  any \\ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\\n1\\n\", metadata={'source': 'Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/source_folder/Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'page': 0, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Writer', 'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext, AppendMode 1.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20090324173315Z00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240113122424Z00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), 0.28061143), (Document(page_content=\"8.\\nSimplified Payment Verification\\nIt is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep \\na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying \\nnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch \\nlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.  He can't check the transaction for \\nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, \\nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more \\nvulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.  While network nodes can verify \\ntransactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated \\ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.  One strategy to \\nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid \\nblock, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to \\nconfirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to \\nrun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\\n9.\\nCombining and Splitting Value\\nAlthough it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a \\nseparate transaction for every cent in a transfer.  To allow value to be split and combined, \\ntransactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.  Normally there will be either a single input \\nfrom a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two \\noutputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.  \\nIt should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those \\ntransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.  There is never the need to extract a \\ncomplete standalone copy of a transaction's history.\\n5\\nTransaction\\nIn\\n...\\nIn\\nOut\\n...\\nHash01\\nHash2\\nHash3\\nHash23\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nBlock Header\\nMerkle Root\\nPrev Hash\\nNonce\\nMerkle Branch for Tx3\\nLongest Proof-of-Work Chain\\nTx3\\n\", metadata={'source': 'Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/source_folder/Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Writer', 'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext, AppendMode 1.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20090324173315Z00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240113122424Z00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), 0.30277896), (Document(page_content=\"New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes.  As long as they reach \\nmany nodes, they will get into a block before long.  Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped \\nmessages.  If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and \\nrealizes it missed one.\\n6.\\nIncentive\\nBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned \\nby the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides \\na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. \\nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending \\nresources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is \\nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of \\nthe block containing the transaction.  Once a predetermined number of coins have entered \\ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation \\nfree.\\nThe incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.  If a greedy attacker is able to \\nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it \\nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to \\nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than \\neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\\n7.\\nReclaiming Disk Space\\nOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before \\nit can be discarded to save disk space.  To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, \\ntransactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. \\nOld blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.

Privacy\\nThe traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the \\nparties involved and the trusted third party.  The necessity to announce all transactions publicly \\nprecludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in \\nanother place: by keeping public keys anonymous.  The public can see that someone is sending \\nan amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.  This is \\nsimilar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of \\nindividual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.\\nAs an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them \\nfrom being linked to a common owner.  Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input \\ntransactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.  The risk \\nis that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to \\nthe same owner.\\n11. Calculations\\nWe consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest \\nchain.  Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such \\nas creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  Nodes are \\nnot going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block \\ncontaining them.  An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back \\nmoney he recently spent.\\nThe race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial \\nRandom Walk.  The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its \\nlead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker\\'s chain being extended by one block, reducing the \\ngap by -1.\\nThe probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler\\'s \\nRuin problem.  Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an \\ninfinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven.  We can calculate the probability he ever \\nreaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:\\np = probability an honest node finds the next block\\nq = probability the attacker finds the next block\\nqz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind\\nq z={\\n1\\nif p≤q\\n\\ue09eq/ p\\ue09f\\nz\\nif p\\ue085q}\\n6\\nIdentities\\nTransactions\\nTrusted\\nThird Party\\nCounterparty\\nPublic\\nIdentities\\nTransactions\\nPublic\\nNew Privacy Model\\nTraditional Privacy Model\\n', metadata={'source': 'Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/source_folder/Bitcoin Whitepaper.pdf', 'page': 5, 'total_pages': 9, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Writer', 'producer': 'macOS Version 14.2.1 (Build 23C71) Quartz PDFContext, AppendMode 1.1', 'creationDate': \"D:20090324173315Z00'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240113122424Z00'00'\", 'trapped': ''}), 0.32038248)]\n"

However, when he sees Chewbacca without Han and that Rey came on\\nthe Millennium Falcon, he inquires about what has gone on with his family. Rey informs Luke about Solo's\\ndeath at the hands of Kylo Ren and that the First Order has risen to rule the galaxy. Rey asks Luke to train\\nher in the ways of the Force. Luke is initially reluctant to train Rey, telling her that it is time for the Jedi\\nOrder to end.\\nAfter some persuasion from R2-D2, however, Luke starts training Rey, but grows increasingly afraid of her\\npower. Luke then tells Rey the history of the Jedi Order, how Darth Sidious rose to power and how the Jedi\\nwere partly responsible for his father's fall to the dark side. Luke also initially tells Rey that Ben was\\ncorrupted by Snoke, and destroyed the Jedi Temple he confronted his treasonous nephew. Ultimately,\\nhowever, Luke tells Rey the truth: He had briefly considered killing the sleeping Ben after seeing a vision\\nof the destruction he could cause, but immediately relented; Ben woke to see Luke with his lightsaber\\ndrawn and turned to the dark side because he felt betrayed. Upon learning this, Rey urges Luke to help her\\nredeem Ben, but he refuses to participate in this nor help the Resistance. When Rey leaves, an embittered\\nLuke tries to burn the Jedi temple, but fails. He is then visited by the spirit of Yoda, who assures Luke that\\nhe still has a purpose.\\nLuke appears on the planet Crait, as the Resistance are staging a standoff against the First Order, and he\\napologizes to Leia for allowing Ben to fall to the dark side.

Meaning to isolate herself, she throws Luke's lightsaber towards the burning wreckage of\\nRen's TIE whisper, in which she had traveled to her new home. Luke appears as a Force spirit, and\\nreprimands Rey for treating the lightsaber with disrespect. Luke then admits that he was wrong not to\\nparticipate in the Resistance, and thanks Rey for helping him rediscover himself. Luke convinces Rey to not\\nview herself as a Palpatine, but as the good person Leia saw her as when training her, and not to give up on\\nher battle against the Sith. Luke lends Rey his old T-65B X-wing Red Five and tells Rey to combine his\\nfather's lightsaber with Leia's in her battle on Exegol. He also restrengthened Rey when she reached out to\\nand heard the voices of the past Jedi to help her destroy Palpatine once and for all.\\nAfter Rey vanquishes Palpatine once and for all, she visits the moisture farm on Tatooine where Luke was\\nraised.

Luke\\ncollapses but is later rescued by Han. When the Empire discovers\\nthe Rebel base on Hoth, Luke leads his squadron of snowspeeders\\nto battle the enemy's AT-ATs, but he is forced to retreat when his\\nwingmen are overwhelmed. Escaping in his X-wing, he travels to\\nDagobah and meets Yoda. He undergoes rigorous Jedi training, quickly increasing his power in the Force.\\nDuring his training, Luke sees a vision of his friends in danger. Against both Obi-Wan and Yoda's advice to\\nstay and complete his training, he travels to Bespin to save them, unwittingly falling into a trap set by Vader.\\nHe engages in a lightsaber duel with Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for Vader;\\nthe Sith Lord easily overpowers Luke and severs his right hand. Vader then reveals that he is Luke's father,\\nand offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy at his side.

He\\nsurvives, but is pulled into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City, and left hanging perilously onto\\na vane rod.

Luke then learns\\nfrom Obi-Wan's spirit that he has a twin sister, whom he immediately realizes is princess Leia. Both Jedi\\nMasters tell Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training and save the galaxy, but he is disturbed\\nby the idea of killing his own father.\\nArriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring his\\nfather back from the dark side of the Force. Vader brings Luke to the second Death Star orbiting around\\nEndor, where his master, Emperor Palpatine, tries to tempt Luke to the dark side, revealing his plan to\\ndestroy the Rebel fleet. Luke lashes out at the Emperor with his lightsaber, but Vader blocks his strike, and\\nfather and son once again duel with each other. Luke regains control of his emotions until Vader senses that\\nLuke has a sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side if Luke will not submit.
